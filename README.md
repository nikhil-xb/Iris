This is the Neural Network classification solution on the Iris Dataset utilizing 3 layers, and having relu & softmax as activation function. Cross Entropy Loss is implemented for gradient descent. 

This is the initial notebook with the agenda of helping you understand how to implement basic neural network architecture in a dataset.
